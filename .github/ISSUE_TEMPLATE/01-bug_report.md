### Expected behavior
Provide a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

<!--
For BPMN rendering problems, please test your BPMN diagram with other BPMN vendors.
For example, you can use:
  - the `bpmn-js` demo: https://demo.bpmn.io/new)
  - the `bpmn-visualization` example comparing the rendering with `bpmn-js`: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/master/examples/misc/compare-with-bpmn-js/index.html.
  In this URL, you can replace `master` by a specific tag (for example v0.43.0) to check a specific version of `bpmn-visualization`. 

Be aware that `bpmn-visualization` and `bpmn-js` have different rendering behavior, in particular for:
  - label activity: https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues/2253
  - default label position: https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues/2306
  - fill color: https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues/2590#issuecomment-1486053921
