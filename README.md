# Roadmap

`BPMN Visualization JS` is in early development stages and is subject to changes until the `1.0.0` version is released.

We are currently focusing on the [BPMN support](https://process-analytics.github.io/bpmn-visualization-js/#bpmn-support-roadmap)
to be able to render most of the BPMN elements.

Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points.

# Development

To build the project, see the [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#Build) :slightly_smiling_face:
