# Roadmap

`BPMN Visualization JS` is in early development stages and is subject to changes until the `1.0.0` version is released.

We are currently focusing on the [BPMN support](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/milestone/6)
to be able to render most of the BPMN elements.

Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points.
