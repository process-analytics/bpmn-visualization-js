`bpmn-visualization` is a TypeScript library for visualizing processes and their execution data, in https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/[BPMN] format, with simplicity.

Based on the customization capability, it provides a set of diagram visualization features that includes additional display options for execution data (_highlighting of some elements_, _adding customizable overlays_, and more) as well as personalized interactive capabilities (_mouse hover_, _click_, and more).

We hope it will help you to create applications for process visualization and analysis 🙂
