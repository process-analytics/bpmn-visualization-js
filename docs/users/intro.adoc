`bpmn-visualization` is a TypeScript library for visualizing process execution data on https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/[BPMN] diagrams, with simplicity.

Based on the customization capability, it provides a set of diagram visualization features that includes additional display options for execution data (_highlighting of some elements_, _adding customizable overlays_, and more) as well as personalized interactive capabilities (_mouse hover_, _click_, and more).

We hope it will help you to create applications for process visualization and analysis ðŸ™‚
