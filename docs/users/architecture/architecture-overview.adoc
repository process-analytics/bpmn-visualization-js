=== Architecture Overview

`bpmn-visualization` consists on 2 main modules:

* parsing: read a BPMN source (xml string) and convert it into its own <<bpmn-internal-model,internal Model>>.
* rendering: display the BPMN diagrams represented by the internal Model, using the https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/[mxGraph library]
