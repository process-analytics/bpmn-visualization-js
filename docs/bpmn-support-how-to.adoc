= BPMN Support - How To
:icons: font

== Elements detection

Except for special container elements like `Pool`, `Lane` and `Subprocess`, detecting a new BPMN element only requires to
add a new value in the `ShapeBpmnElementKind` enum.

The `ProcessConverter` uses the `ShapeBpmnElementKind` values to detect elements in the BPMN source.

IMPORTANT: Do not forget to add parsing (xml and json) tests related to the new BPMN element to ensure that the parser
is able to make it available to the `ProcessConverter`


== Elements rendering

When inserting an element on the graph, a style is passed to identify the way it will be rendered.

The https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/js-api/files/view/mxStylesheet-js.html[style] is registered in `MxGraphConfigurator`
In particular, it refers to the name of a https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/js-api/files/shape/mxShape-js.html[mxShape]
used for the rendering.

Custom BPMN shapes are also register by the `MxGraphConfigurator`
